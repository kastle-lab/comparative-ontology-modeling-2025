# Same Data; Different Model (SDDM 2026)

## Abstract
Ontologies dictate how data are related to each other, acting as the blueprint of a specific use-case. Hence, different ontology engineering methods exist to serve those use-cases. Selecting an appropriate methodology is crucial; the modeling choices we make shape what the data can express and how concepts are grouped together. Therefore, in terms of exploring said appropriate methodology, it becomes important to take a look on how the same underlying data behave when modeled through different approaches. By comparing distinct ontology engineering methods, we can observe how hierarchies form, how constraints change, and how these differences affect interpretability and knowledge organization. Therefore, we propose a half-day tutorial in order to compare and visualize the results of two modeling techniques: the Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology and the eXtreme Design with Content Ontology Design Patterns (XD) methodology, while also investigating how an LLM falls into the process.

5. **Session 3 — Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**  
   [Session](./sessions/bfo/bfo.md) (40 minutes)  
   Realist upper-ontology modeling focusing on ontological distinctions, constraints, and alignment with OBO Foundry principles.

6. **Comparative Analysis, Embeddings & Discussion** (30 minutes)  
   Knowledge graph embeddings, dimensionality reduction (t-SNE / UMAP) visualization of results, and guided discussion of methodological trade-offs.
