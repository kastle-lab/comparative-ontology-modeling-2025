## Tutorial Overview

Ontologies dictate how data are related and interpreted. Different ontology engineering methodologies lead to different hierarchies, constraints, modular structures, and reasoning behaviors—even when applied to the same dataset.

In this tutorial, participants will:
- Apply **multiple ontology modeling methodologies** to the same dataset
- Compare the resulting ontological structures
- Train **knowledge graph embeddings** on the produced triples
- Visualize and analyze semantic coherence using **t-SNE / UMAP**
- Discuss strengths, weaknesses, and interoperability implications

The tutorial uses the **PFAS dataset**, previously employed in SDDM 2024.

## Sessions

All sessions follow a common structure:
1. Short methodological introduction
2. Hands-on modeling
3. Embedding-based analysis and visualization
4. Comparative discussion

### Introductory Comparison
**Presenter:** Davide Di Pierro  

A high-level overview of contemporary ontology engineering methodologies, positioning LOT, XD and BFO.

---

### eXtreme Design (XD)
**Presenters:** Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese, Anna Sofia Lippolis  



---

### Linked Open Terms (LOT) + Chowlk
**Presenter:** María Poveda-Villalón  




---


### Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
**Presenter:** John Beverly  


---

### Hands-On Collaborative Modeling
Participants apply one or more methodologies to the PFAS dataset, guided by the session leads.

---

### Embedding Evaluation & Visualization
- Knowledge graph embeddings
- Dimensionality reduction using **t-SNE / UMAP**
- Visual inspection of semantic clusters and gaps

---

### Comparative Analysis
A joint discussion synthesizing results across methodologies, focusing on:
- Structural differences
- Semantic coherence
- Interoperability challenges
- Best practices
